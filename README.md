## 🚀 Overview

**SonicShield** is an intelligent audio classification system designed to assist law enforcement and public safety agencies by analyzing and detecting crime-related sounds in real time. Using advanced machine learning and spectral filtering techniques, SonicShield can differentiate between normal environmental noise and potential indicators of criminal activity—like gunshots, screams, glass breaking, or fights.

This tool aims to bridge the gap in current surveillance systems by providing a scalable, affordable, and privacy-preserving way to enhance situational awareness in urban and rural settings alike.

Built for **national-level hackathon competition**, this project demonstrates the future of public safety technology through intelligent audio monitoring and classification.

## ✨ Key Features
## 1. Multi-Class Audio Classification
SonicShield can recognize and distinguish between various types of crime-related audio events.
It uses a deep learning model trained on labeled audio data to classify these sounds accurately.

## 2. Spectral Filtering for Accuracy
We apply spectral filtering techniques to clean and enhance audio input before it reaches the model. This means:
Irrelevant background noise is filtered out
Only important frequency patterns are analyzed
This boosts the accuracy and reduces false positives in noisy environments like streets or public places.

## 3. Real-Time Detection Capability
SonicShield is optimized for real-time inference, making it suitable for:
Live surveillance audio feeds
Smart microphones or IoT-enabled security systems
This ensures immediate detection and response to suspicious sounds.

## 4. Visual Audio Analytics
Every audio clip is converted into a spectrogram (a visual representation of sound frequencies).
These are used to:
Improve model explainability
Help investigators visualize what was heard
Debug or validate model predictions

## 5. Modular and Scalable Architecture
The project is built with flexibility in mind:
Easily integrates into existing surveillance systems
Can be deployed on cloud servers or edge devices (like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)
Well-structured codebase for quick customization or model upgrades

## 🧠 AI Classification Categories

The system classifies audio into the following threat categories:

| Category | Description | Threat Level |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 🔫 **gun_shot** | Firearm discharge detection | **HIGH** |
| 🪟 **glass_breaking** | Window/glass destruction | **MEDIUM** |
| 😱 **scream** | Distress calls and screams | **HIGH** |
| 🚨 **siren** | Emergency vehicle sirens | **LOW** |
| 🚗 **engine_idling** | Vehicle engine sounds | **LOW** |
| ✅ **normal** | Regular environmental audio | **SAFE** |
